Designed to provide a truly wireless audio experience like no other, the Legion H600 sports a premium 2.4 GHz lossless wireless receiver, tournament-grade audio, wired and magnetic contact charging, and a 3.5 mm jack for hassle-free multi-platform support. Its most defining feature is the ability to wirelessly charge when hung from the new Legion S600 Gaming Station so that you donâ€™t have to clutter your desk or remember to plug in the charging cable.
